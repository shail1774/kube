Node :- Physical | Vietual | Cloud

Pod :-
      Smallest unit of kubernetes
      Abstraction over container
      Usually 1 app per pod
      each pod has its own ip address
      get new ip address on recreation
      
      
Service :- Permanant IP address attached to each pod
           lifecycle of pod and service is not connected.
           
           
Ingress :- Secure protocol and domain name
           Request goes to ingress and ingress forwarding request to service.
           
           
Config Map :- 
              External configuration of your application.
              Usually container configuration data
              In k8s, youjust connect configmap to pod.
              
              
   
 Secrets :- 
            It just like config map but the diffrance is used to store secret data.
            
            -> credentials
            -> base64 encoded format
            -> password | Certificates
            
            Just like config map you just connect secret to pod.
            Use configMap or secret data using it as environment variables or as a properties file.
            secret must be created before deployment.
            
            
 Deployment :- 
                Define blueprint of pods
                Replica sets
                abstraction of pods
                database can't be replicated via deployment
                
                
 Statefulset :-
          
                Avoid data inconsistency
                replication
                specially for DB's
                deployment for stateless apps
                statefulset for stateful app or DB.
